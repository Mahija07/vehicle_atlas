# 🛡️ Functional Safety & ISO 26262

Welcome to the safety vault of automotive software.  
If AUTOSAR is the brain of the car, **Functional Safety** is the seatbelt for your software — ensuring the system does what it's *supposed to*, even when things go wrong.

## 🧠 What is Functional Safety?

Functional Safety ensures that **electronic systems behave safely** in case of faults or failures.

 It’s all about making sure:  
 “If something fails, nothing catastrophic happens.”

📘 Governed by **ISO 26262**, which is:
 “Road vehicles – Functional safety”  
The international standard for developing safety-related automotive systems.

## 🎯 Safety Goals & ASIL Levels

### ✔️ **Safety Goal**
A high-level safety requirement derived from hazard analysis.

Example:  
 “Prevent unintended airbag deployment while driving.”

---

### 🧮 **ASIL – Automotive Safety Integrity Level**

ASIL defines **how critical a safety function is**.  
It ranges from:
- **QM** – Quality Management (not safety-critical)
- **ASIL A** – Low safety risk
- **ASIL B**
- **ASIL C**
- **ASIL D** – Highest safety risk (life-threatening)

### ASIL is based on:
| Factor     | What it Means                      |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| **Severity (S)**   | How bad is the potential harm?       |
| **Exposure (E)**   | How often does the situation occur? |
| **Controllability (C)** | Can the driver control the situation? |

 ASIL = Function of **S × E × C**

## 🔄 Safety Lifecycle (per ISO 26262)

Functional safety is not just a test — it’s a **full lifecycle**.  
Starts from concept → ends at retirement of the vehicle.

### Main Phases:

1. **Hazard & Risk Analysis**
2. **Define Safety Goals**
3. **Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs)**
4. **Technical Safety Requirements (TSRs)**
5. **Software Safety Requirements**
6. **Design, Implementation & Verification**
7. **Testing & Validation**
8. **Production & Post-Production Monitoring**

 ⚙️ Every step has traceability, reviews, and safety confirmations.

## 🚗 Real-World Functional Safety Examples

| Scenario                        | Functional Safety Need                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Brake-by-wire failure           | Must switch to mechanical backup or alert driver      |
| Sudden unintended acceleration  | Detect fault and limit throttle                       |
| Airbag controller malfunction   | Avoid false deployment; ensure real impact detection  |
| Electric steering fault         | Trigger fallback to manual or alert system            |
| Camera signal lost in ADAS      | Trigger safe-state mode (e.g., limit speed)           |

## 🧪 Functional Safety in Development

✅ Uses:
- **Safety mechanisms** (redundancy, monitoring, watchdogs)
- **FMEDA** – Failure Modes, Effects, and Diagnostic Analysis
- **FMEA** – Failure Mode and Effects Analysis
- **ASIL decomposition** to split safety across components

✅ Safety testing includes:
- **Fault injection**
- **Boundary tests**
- **End-to-end verification** of safety paths

---

## 📌 Summary

- **Functional Safety** = Protect humans from malfunctioning electronics
- Governed by **ISO 26262** standard
- **ASIL levels** define the risk severity
- A complete **safety lifecycle** is followed
- Found in ECUs for **braking, steering, ADAS, airbags, etc.**

 Safety isn't optional — it’s designed from Day 1.  
 Because software bugs shouldn't crash more than your app. 🚗🔥
